							The question is whether or not, for all problems for which an algorithm can verify a given solution quickly (that is, in polynomial time), an algorithm can also find that solution quickly. Since the former describes the class of problems termed NP, while the latter describes P, the question is equivalent to asking whether all problems in NP are also in P. This is generally considered one of the most important open questions in mathematics and theoretical computer science as it has far-reaching consequences to other problems in mathematics, and to biology, philosophy[4] and cryptography (see P versus NP problem proof consequences). A common example of an NP problem not known to be in P is the travelling salesman problem.
							Most mathematicians and computer scientists expect that P ≠ NP; however, it remains to be proven.[5]
							The official statement of the problem was given by Stephen Cook.
